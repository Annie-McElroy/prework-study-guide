        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating webpages.</li>
          <li>HTML consist of a series of elements. Elements tell the browser how to display content.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Header (h) is an element that has 6 levels, h1 should only be used once on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Image element needs a source (src) and a description (alt).</li>
          <li>List can be created in unordered (ul) or ordered (ol) fashion with list items (li) nested within.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (or CSS) is the language used to style and HTML document. Describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>External CSS style sheet is a seperate file containing only the CSS code that is linked to the HTML file. This is preferred to create "separation of concerns".</li>
              <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Think of it as each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
              <li>Inline CSS allows to add CSS coding inline with HTML coding, but is infelxible.</li>
              <li>Internal CSS style sheet puts CSS styles in the "Head" of the HTML sheet but puts all you code together in one file.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>CSS Syntac consists of a selector (points to HTML element to be styled) and declaration block (how HTML element should be styled).</li>
          <li>Declaration block can contain one or more declasrations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes CSS property name and value, separated by a colon. Some examples:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A very simple example would be "color: red;" where color is the property and red is the value.</li>
              <li>To align text in a certain fashion we'd use the property "text-align" and the value would indicate alignment (ex: center).</li>
              <li>Other properties include:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
                  <li>Height/width are used to set the height and width of an element. Values include auto (default), length (defined in px, cm, etc.), percentage %, and more.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>The class selector allows us to style any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Class atrtibute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. Ex: Each topic section is classed as "card" which allows for each section to be styled in a box with a shadow.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer.</li>
          <li>Key terms to understand:
            <ul>
              <li>Repository (or Repo): In short is a project on GitHub. Contains all files and revision histories.</li>
              <li>Branch: Each repository can contain multiple copies of the same project. Each separate version is a "branch" of the original. Allows for separation of work to be done on same project without running into conflicts and allows for ease of version control.</li>
              <li>Merging: When done with revisions on a branch, that branch can then be merged into the main branch.</li>
              <li>Commit: A record of change. Has a unique id for tracking purposes and contains user-defined messages that describes changes made.</li>
              <li>Issues: Used to help organize yourself within GitHub. Commonly used to track bugs or to-dos.</li>
              <li>Pull/push: "Pulling" is to pull respository files onto local copies. Pushing is to update repository files with changes made locally.</li>
              <li>Pull request: Allows for other users to review your "push" from branch before merged into main branch. Common practice for collaborative projects.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Below are common Git commands:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git checkout -b "branch-name": creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
              <li>git pull: fetch and merge any commits from the remote repository/branch</li>
              <li>git pull origin main: pulls and updates local repository (computer file) with the latest update of the main branch from a remote repository (github)</li>
              <li>git push: uploads content to a remote respository (github)</li>
              <li>git rm "file": delete the file from project</li>
              <li>git log: shows all commits in the current branch's history</li>
              <li>git add -A: adds all files in working branch as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript adds interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. Example: Variable is a box called "Shape", the value Circle is contained in the box "Shape".</li>
          <li>There are several types of variables:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>String: A squences of text, must be enclosed in single or double quote marks.</li>
              <li>Number: Used for numbers. Does not have quotes around them.</li>
              <li>Boolean: True/False value. True/False are special keywords that don't require quote marks.</li>
              <li>Array: Strucutre that allows storing mulitple values in a single reference. Example: Variable "Shapes" stores the values Circle, Square, and Triangle.</li>
              <li>Object: Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Conditionals are code strucutres used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common conditional is the "if...else" statement.</li>
          <li>Functions defines a block of code to perform a specific task. Functions do not excute automatically, instead you must call a fuction by name in order to execute. This allows the code to be more reasily reusable and ease of control.</li>
          <li>JavaScript supports control flow statements. Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
