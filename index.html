          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how mcuh space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are preferred to create "separation of concerns".</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It's based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS allows to add CSS coding inline with HTML coding, but is infelxible.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet puts CSS styles in the "Head" of the HTML sheet but puts all you code together in one file.</li>
          <li>Class attribues allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Classs atrtibute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
