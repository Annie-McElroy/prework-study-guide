# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was built to help study HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript for myself and fellow bootcamp students. The website contains  a notes section with linked resources along with a interactive way to begin studying within the DevTools Console. By building this website I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, and JavaScript to better prepare myself for my upcoming bootcamp. I look forward to the continued use of this site and to look back on it as my first webpage built and compare to how far I've gone.

## Usage

Each section of the website will contain detailed notes and links to resources for each of the four topics: HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, and JavaScript.

The webpage also allows for a way to study using the DevTools Console. Here you can see how JavaScript is running along with a suggestion on what to study. To open the Chrome DevTools press Command+Option+I (macOS) or Constroe+Shift_I (Windows). A console panel will appear on the right hand side of the website. Please make sure to select "Console" at the top. Here you will find all a list of our four topcis as well as a suggestion on what to study first.
